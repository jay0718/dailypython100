# 100 Days of Python Challenge Projects
This is a collection of Python code projects that I solved while taking the "100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021" course on Udemy.

The course contains 100 different types of projects/challenges, and each project has a specific goal to complete. The projects are designed to improve Python programming skills and help become a better programmer.
